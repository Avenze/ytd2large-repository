  <li>The link copied must look like the following:</li>
  <i>https://files.gta5-mods.com/uploads/xxxxxxxxxxxx/yyyyyyyyyyyyyy.zip</i>
  <li>and NOT like the following:</li>
  <i>https://www.gta5-mods.com/vehicles/2009-acura-tl-replace</i>
  
  <li>Paste the copied link into the "Add to queue" textbox, and then press the "Add to queue" button.</li>
  <li>You can repeat this however many times you'd like, then when you are finished, you can just press the "Start" button</li>
  <li>Go grab yourself a drink while this finished it's magic, and then you should find the finished resources in the folder the .exe is located in</li>
</ul>
  
<b>Information:</b>
<ul>
  <li>If any of the outputted folders are empty, just a fxmanifest.lua file and the stream folder, the program was unable to find a .rpf file and the vehicle is    incompatible with this tool.</li>
  <li>The speed of the conversion process depends on your hardware and your network connection.</li>
</ul>
